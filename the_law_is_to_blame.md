# The Law is to Blame: the Vulnerable Status of Common Property Rights in Sub-Saharan Africa

Customary tenure thoughts:

 > Whether recognized by statutory laws or not, African rural commu-nities consider themselves to be the traditional owners of not just their houseplots and farms but also the forests, pastures and other naturally collectiveresources which fall within their respective domains. p.734

> The description of indigenous tenure regimes as customary or traditional can be misleading in that it may promote a view of these systemsas archaic. This belies their more singular essence as community based andtherefore sustained by the *living* community. As well as some norms beingreconstructed by the state, norms may be generationally reinterpreted at the local level in light of current-day realities; there is abundant evidence that this has occurred and continues to do so. As land shortage and commoditization increase, pertinent evolutions have included discernible hardening of the idea of ‘our land’ as ‘our real property’ and increasing rigidity of once relatively ﬂuid boundaries between community domains.
