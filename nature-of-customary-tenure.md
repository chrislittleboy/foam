# Nature of Customary Tenure

This chapter looks at customary tenure in Nigeria.
I define tenure systems: see the Voluntary Guidelines on the Governance of Tenure - FAO2012.
This encompasses people, resources, and systems governing how they interact.
I then describe three different understandings of customary tenure: traditional, constructed and adaptable.
Traditional: sons of the soil, local governance, land distributed by community head, disputes arbitrated within group.
Constructed: colonialism created customary tenure as systems led by chiefs. This enabled hierarchical management.
Adaptable: customary tenure systems are best described as adaptable to circumstances.
I explore the colonial evolution of land tenure regimes in Nigeria (See [[ck meek]] and [[afigbo]]).
I also explore the Land Use Act 1978 (the [[LUA]]).
