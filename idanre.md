Epic poem by Wole [[Soyinka]]

7 parts, about creation, cyclical patterns in history, and humanity

1. Deluge - 
	Ogun (god of war and creativity, guardian of the road)
	Sango (god of lightning and electricity)
	Cordial - but argument over brawl for the palm-wine girl Oya
	Bioloical life created on earth downpour of rain - "deluge"
2. ... And after
People start cultivating the earth
3. Pilgrimage
Ogun returns, sees the boulder cast by man, kills shrines desecrated by men
4. The beginning
Fashioned weapons, retreated to hill, man came up and gave wine and asked to lead. Too strong for such a small task
5. The battle
Got drunk - insubstantial feast, and unreasonable request - went on rage with his own weapons - destruction - call for humans to be 'earthed', believe in their own abilities - not rely on powerful gods
6. Recessional
Develops optimism, evolution, mobious strip, self-devouring snake.
7. Harvest
"A dawn of bright processions, the sun peacocked / loud"
"Light burnished to a copper earth, cornucopia / fell in light cascades around her feet"
"The first fruits rose from subterranean hoards / first in our vision, corn sheaves rose over the hill / Long before the bearers, domes of eggs and flesh, of palm fruit, red, oil black, froth flew in sun bubbles / burst over throngs of golden gourds"
