# Critical Realism

Third philosophical position to rival positivism and relativism. Understands that the world exists and is objectively real. However, we cannot see the world empirically, since ontology is stratified (real, actual and empirical; structures, mechanisms and events). Epistemic relativism and ontological realism.
