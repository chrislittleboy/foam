# Institutional change on the ground: an analysis of land rights in rural Nigeria

My [[PhD introduction]] was split in three subchapters. One on the nature of customary tenure, one on the nature of institutional change, and one on the logic of the thesis.

My [[PhD second section]] of the phd was a [[natural experiment]] of the Evolutionary Theory of Land Rights.

My [[PhD third section]] was an evaluation of the Systematic land Titling and Registration (SLTR) in Ondo State, Nigeria.
