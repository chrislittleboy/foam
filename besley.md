Tim Besley wrote an article about how tenure security leads to agricultural productivity. Three mechanisms - credit, assurance and allocative efficiency.
Credit because secure rights can be used as collateral.
Assurance because secure rights are less likely to be expropriated.
Allocative because secure rights can be transferred to most efficient users.
