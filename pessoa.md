# Fernando Pessoa

Portuguese poet early 20thC. Upbringing in SA.

From my village I see as much as from earth one can see of the Universe...
Therefore, my village is as big as any other earth
Because I am the size of what I see
And not the size of my own height
In the cities life is smaller
Than here at my home upon the crest of this ----------
In the cities the houses shut the view and lock it
Hide the horizon, push our gaze far away from all the sky
Make us small because they take away from us what our eyes can give
And make us poor because our only wealth is to see

...

At times, on days of flawless and exact light
When things have all the reality they can have,
I stop and ask myself
Why even I attibute
Beauty to things

Has a flower somehow beauty?
Is their beauty somehow in a fruit?
No, they have colour and form
And existence only
Beauty is the name of something that does not existence
Which I give to things in exchange for the pleasure they give me.
It signifies nothing
And yet why do I say of things: they are beautiful?

...

One wildly clear day,
The kind when you wish you had done a pile of work
Not to have to do any that day,
I cayght sight, like a road ahead among terees
Of what might be the Great Secret,
That Great Mystery the false poets speak of.

I saw that there is no Nature
That Nature does not exist
That there are mountains, valleys, plains,
That there are trees, flowers, grasses,
That there are streams and stones,
But that there is not a whole to which this belongs,
That any real and true connection
Is a disease of our ideas.
Nature is parts without a whole.
That, perhaps, is the mystery they speak of.
