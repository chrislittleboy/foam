# Stephan Zweig

Austrian author. Wrote Chess, and a number of short stories.

Chess is about a former POW, who is on a ship crossing the atlantic with a great chess champion. During his time as a POW, he stole a chess book from a guard (150 greatest games) and began to learn abstractly and see many moves ahead in his head. He became a great chess player through boredom and time to focus, but was driven mad by the experience. On the voyage, he plays a game with the master, beats him, but is driven mad once more by accessing that part of his brain.
