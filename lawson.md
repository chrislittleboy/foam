Concerned with social ontology.

Wrote Economics and Reality in 1997. Reality is ontologically stratified in three domains. Structures, mechanisms and events. Structures are things that exist objectively, mechanismms produce events when structures interact, and events are the things that we observe. Core argument rests on positivism as a reduction of social reality. Not all reality is not observable. Econometrics as a tool for understanding reality is inappropriate.

Based on Roy [[Bhaskar]]'s previous work.

Also, article by [[Bygstad and Munkveld]] on how to conduct Critical Realist research based on these ideas. Critique of reductive positivism.
