# The 'new' African customary land tenure. Characteristic, features, and policy implications of a new policy paradigm.

"An omnibus term that at its most basic means collectively owned land usually under the authority of traditional leadership."

"The analysis of the neo-liberalised customary tenure acknowledges the variations in policies and practices across Africa. Indeed it also acknowledges that in many parts elements of both paradigms may exist side by side while the new customary tenure beds in. The paper captures what could only usefully be described as median practices."
