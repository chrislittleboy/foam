Wrote lots of good books!

Diary of a bad year - set in London, about being a depressed expat student.
Life and times of Michael K. Mixed views, but I really like it. About a man with learning difficulties and a cleft lip, who looks after his mother. He journeys around South Africa looking for a better life, and finds it through desparate and precarious journey back to living life off the land. Makes you want to eat his melons.
Disgrace, a sex scandal at a university, where an aged literature professor is disgraced and goes to live with his daughter. About sex, rape, shame, father/daughter relationships.
