# Zizek

Slavoj zizek, contemporary marxist philosopher

This note is highly abridged...

On permissive power - idea that direct authority is easier to navigate than permissive authority
If father says - it is your duty to visit grandmother, clear expectation
If father says, I'm not going to force you to visit your grandmother, you should only go if you want to out of love for her, this is harder to rebel against
Not only should you go, but you are also expected to want to go
Analogy to political correctness, not able to build true bridges across different people (whether race, disability, gender, sexuality etc)
