# John Searle

Wrote about the [[chinese room]].

Also wrote about [[ontology]]. Ontologically subjective, i.e. money, its reality depends on the beliefs about it, as opposed to ontologically objective, i.e. a mountain, whose reality depends on physics. You can have epistemic objectivity, about ontologically subjective things - i.e. net worth. Whereas epistemically subjective, cultures/norms/ideas.

Debated critical realism with [[lawson]].
