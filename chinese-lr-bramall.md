# Chinese Lr Bramall

Two land reforms in China: 
1947-1952 - peasant associations seized landlord land and redistributed. Creation of small-scale farming, and later collective farming.
1981-1983 - second land reform, to make collective farming more productive. Incentives, and decollectivisation.
Griffin, Khan and Ickowitz (GKI) wrote an influential paper, Poverty and the Distribution of Land in 2002. [[gki2002]]
Bramall disagrees with GKI conception of reform 1. Policy preserved interests of rich peasants, while undermining landlordism.
