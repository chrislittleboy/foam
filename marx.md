# Marx

Wrote communist manifesto, Capital.

Linear mode of development. Property has existed for a while in feudal socieities. But capitalism is different - property owned by some in society, and others sell wage labour. Both classess have compulsions to work -- survival and preservation in social order -- so capitalism is dynamic and productive, but stratifies socieity into those who own the means of production (bourgeoisie), and those that do not (proletariat). Key to change is technological revolution. This will create class conflict, leading to revolution, socialism and eventually communism.

See Brenner or Wood for the origins of capitalist development.

See Gramsci for comment on why communist revolution did not happen (civil society/cultural hegemony to appease proletariat through social welfare)development.

See Popper for prominent critique of Marx.
